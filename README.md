## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During this coding challenge, I've gained valuable experience in implementing dynamic and interactive features using CSS and JavaScript. Specifically, I have successfully:

Implemented a Lightbox: I utilized CSS and JavaScript to create a lightbox that enhances user experience by allowing them to view images in an enlarged and focused manner without leaving the current page.

Managed a Shopping Cart: I developed functionality to add and remove items from a shopping cart. This involved dynamically updating the cart's contents, handling item quantities, and calculating the total price.
